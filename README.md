# Marvel-code-test

In order for this to work you will need Marvel API-keys. 
To do this, you will need to do the following: 

Go to https://developer.marvel.com/ and login with your marvel account. 
Then go to "My developer account" where you will find a public and a private API key.
Open Scripts/scripts.js with whatever text-editor you like. 
On the first two rows you will find the following: 

const PUBLIC_API_KEY = 'This should be your public API-key';
const PRIVATE_API_KEY = 'This should be your private API-key';

And replace the text inside the '-marks with your API-keys. 

Press save and open the "index.html"-file and you're good to go!

Have fun.
